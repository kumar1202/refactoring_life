Hi!

Hi!
I am Kumar Abhijeet. I work on building engineering platforms in Gojek and just graduated from RV College of Engineering, Bangalore.

I have an eerie perspective to life, wherein I constantly try and fail to relate completely unrelated subjects and draw parallels which leads to unrevealed findings( well, at least to me xD ). Some of those subjects are software, psychology, music, and life.

Explore the blog and find out some of the most weirdest and interesting ideas, exclusive from my cerebrum.
